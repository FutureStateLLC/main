What is a "Future State"?`r`n`r`n
"A "future state" refers to the planned and improved condition of a process, operation, or system that an organization aims to achieve. It represents the desired state beyond the current situation, often associated with operational improvements or business transformation. In essence, it's the vision of where an organization wants to be in the long term."
